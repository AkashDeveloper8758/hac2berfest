Contribution rules

The project must work when opening index.html.
You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just won't merge it ;).
Do NOT add any build steps e.g npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site).
Do NOT remove Videos, Rules, FAQ, or any other helpful content.
Styling/code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works.
Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.

Avoid Conflicts (Syncing your fork)
An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

git remote add upstream https://github.com/lingonsaft/hacktoberfest
You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing.

git remote -v
To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run.

git merge upstream/master
This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.

For more information on syncing forks read this article from Github.

Who are you and why are you doing this?

We are two programmers from India Shashank and Ankit. We are doing this because we love Open Source and Hacktoberfest. We want to make it easier for people to get started with Hacktoberfest and Open Source.
